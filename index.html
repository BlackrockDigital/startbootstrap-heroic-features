An ecommerce website allows your business to sell your company's products to customers online at the comfort of their own space without them having to buy at the store's location.
An ecommerce website also allows your business to accept payments online by asking your customers to fill in their credit card details on the website.
You can choose whether you want to deliver items sold online to your customers or have them pick up their orders in the store after they place an order.
The ecommerce website will include the best safety features to make sure that your customers sensitive information (such as credit card details) are kept safe.
Your ecommerce website will also have the option of including a blog for the reading pleasure of your clients or other website sections that you want.</p>
